   <!--FAQ - ANSWERS -->
   <div id="contentsecondary">
  <h3><strong>How is this different than search?  </strong></h3>
  <h3>By the time customers start searching online, they’ve already decided which business they want to purchase from. MaxPoint reaches customers earlier in the process by targeting them based on their demographics, interests, and distance from your location, regardless of whether or not they search online. </h3>
  <br />
  
  <h3><strong>Do I need to have a physical location? What about a website?
  </strong></h3>
  <h3>You do not need to have a physical location, although we excel at driving customers to stores, restaurants, and offices. If you’re a service business without a location, such as a landscaping company or a cleaning service, you can still grow your customer base with MaxPoint.</h3>
    <h3>However, you must have a web presence—such as a website, Facebook page, or LinkedIn profile—so we can drive customers to learn more about your business.  </h3>
  <br />

  <h3><strong>How is this different than search?  </strong></h3>
  <h3>By the time customers start searching online, they’ve already decided which business they want to purchase from.

  <br />
  
  <h3><strong>Do I need to have an online ad already?
  </strong></h3>
  <h3>No, we can create an ad for you for free. We will send you the ad to review before it goes live. </h3>
  <br />
  
  <h3><strong>Do you support mobile ads?
  </strong></h3>
  <h3>Yes! We support digital display ads on the PC, mobile, and tablet devices. </h3>
  <br />
  
  <h3><strong>How much will it cost?
  </strong></h3>
  <h3>Plans start at $50/month, but depend on the number of households you want to reach.  </h3>
  <br />
  
  <h3><strong>I already advertise in the newspaper, on the radio, on TV, or in a print publication. Why would I use online advertising instead?
  </strong></h3>
  <h3>Online advertising allows you to reach a large, targeted audience for a lower cost than you would spend for many other advertising channels. And, if you need to change your message or ad, you can do so more quickly via digital.</h3>
  <br />
  
    <h3><strong>What is hyperlocal?
  </strong></h3>
  <h3>Hyperlocal advertising is a strategy where advertisers target customers via local media sources. MaxPoint goes a level deeper by focusing on a subset of local customers—for example, mothers in the Raleigh area. </h3>
